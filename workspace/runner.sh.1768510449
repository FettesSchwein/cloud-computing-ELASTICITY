# Fill in the functions below for each question.
# You may use any programming language(s) in any question.
# You may use other files or scripts in these functions as long as they are in

# All files MUST include source code (e.g., do not just submit jar or pyc files).
#
# We will suggest tools or libraries in each question to enrich your learning.
# You are allowed to solve questions without the recommended tools or libraries.
#
# The colon `:` is a POSIX built-in basically equivalent to the `true` command,
# REPLACE it with your own command in each function.
# Before you fill in your solution, DO NOT remove the colon or the function will
# break because the bash functions are empty!

  # DO NOT MODIFY THIS FUNCTION. It has already been filled out for you.
  #
  # The following description is just for your edification.
  # This functions filters an input stream read from the dataset
  # `pageviews-20180310-000000.gz' using a compiled jar file.
  # You implemented the DataFilter class to write the output into a file named
  # 'output'
  #
  # Instead of working with uncompressed data, this function "pipes" the data
  # from zcat, a utility which can read a compressed to StdOut, into the above
  # mentioned jar file.
  #
  # Hint for Java users in later questions:
  # WE DO NOT compile java code in this function,
  # Instead, we put the `mvn` command in the setup() function
  #
  # Standard output format:
  # No standard output needed

################################################################################
# Grep is a command-line tool for searching plain text that matches a regular
# expression. It will print out all the matching lines by default. It also has
# the option to print out the number of matching lines. It is a simple yet
# powerful tool for searching information.
#
# Note: the input file used in all the questions below is `output`

q1() {
  # (3 points) search a substring in a file with grep
  #
  # Question:
  # Search the output file and print the lines that contain "cloud"
  # as a substring (case insensitive).
  #
  # `grep`, named after "Global/Regular Expression/Print", prints lines that
  # contain a match for a pattern.
  #
  # Try searching the options of GNU grep from the manual page,
  # 1. Display the manual page for "grep": man grep
  # 2. Hit "/", type in the keyword and hit "Enter"
  # 3. Hit "n" to find the next match and "N" to find the previous match
  #
  # Hint: search keyword "case" to find all the options related to "case"
  #
  # Now you can solve the question using:
  # grep options "cloud" input_file
  #
  # Standard output format:
  # <matched_line>
  # <matched_line>
  #
  :
}

q2() {
  # (3 points) search word with grep
  #
  # Question:
  # How many articles are there in the filtered dataset with titles that include
  # "cloud" as a word instead of a substring (case insensitive)?
  #
  # A "cloud" substring must meet two requirements at the same time to be
  # qualified as a word:
  # 1. word boundary before "cloud":
  # "cloud" is at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word
  # constituent character.
  # 2. word boundary after "cloud":
  # Similarly, "cloud" must be either at the end of the line or followed by
  # a non-word constituent character.
  #
  # Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore,
  # i.e. [a-zA-Z_0-9]
  #
  # To understand the concept of word boundary, please read:
  # http://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html
  #
  # Valid examples:
  # Cloud	45
  # Asperitas_(cloud)	9
  # Cloud-based_networking	4
  #
  # Invalid examples:
  # Cloud_computing	14
  # SoundCloud 43
  # Cloud9_(team)	1
  #
  #
  # Search the options of GNU grep that:
  # 1. suppress normal output which will print the matched lines, and print a
  # count of matching lines instead
  # 2. select lines containing matches that form whole words instead of
  # substrings
  # 3. search in a case-insensitive way
  #
  # Hint:
  # 1. search keyword "count" in the grep manual page
  # 2. search keyword "word" in the grep manual page
  #
  # Solve the question using:
  # grep options "cloud" input_filename
  #
  # Standard output format:
  # <number>
  :
}

q3() {
  # (4 points) match the position of pattern with grep using anchors
  #
  # Anchors in regular expressions are used to match a pattern at a certain position
  #
  # Question:
  # Print all the lines that start with the substring "cloud" (case insensitive)
  #
  # Valid examples:
  # Cloud	45
  # Cloud_computing	14
  # Cloud9_(team)	1
  # Cloud-based_networking	4
  #
  # Invalid examples:
  # Asperitas_(cloud)	9
  # SoundCloud 43
  #
  # Search the options of GNU grep that:
  # 1. interpret the pattern as a Perl regex for additional functionality
  #
  # Hint:
  # search keyword "perl" in the grep manual page to find the option
  # that enables perl regex
  #
  # Here are some clues related to the syntax of regular expressions in Perl:
  # 1. learn how to use an anchor in a regular expression
  #    https://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html
  #
  # Solve the question using:
  # grep options pattern input_filename
  #
  # Standard output format:
  # <matched_line>
  # <matched_line>
